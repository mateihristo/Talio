## Description of project
Talio is an task-manager application, which allows multiple users to create tasks which are organized
in lists and boards. It was developed in Java, using Spring Boot and JavaFX for a university group project. I
mainly worked on the Spring controllers. While working on it, I learned about the REST architecture, how to
create REST controllers with Spring Boot and test them with Mockito

## How to run it
1. Run the server by either running server/src/main/java/server/Main.java in Intellij or by writing "gradlew bootrun" in a terminal.
2. Run 1 or more clients by either running client/src/main/java/client/Main.java in Intellij or by writing "gradlew run" in another terminal tab.
